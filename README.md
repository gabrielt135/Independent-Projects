# Independent-Projects
A small yet growing list of projects that I will complete or have completed in the near future/past respectively.

  â€¢ Discord Bots:
   - LT3R-BT (Looter Bot) (Tentative name): A bot that will search and scrape web pages for necessary information on weapons and items from various looter 
     games. Version 1.0 will support only Borderlands games for now.
     
   - MMO scheduler Bot: Will create events and remind you and anyone else you chose to attend said event in an MMO. Still in pre-development phase for now.
